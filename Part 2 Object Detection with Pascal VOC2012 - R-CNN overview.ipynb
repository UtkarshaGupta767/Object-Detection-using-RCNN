    "R-CNN is a successful object detection algorithm that can return class label of objects and their bounding boxes for a given image. The work is published in 2013 and there have been many faster algorithms for the object detection algorithm (e.g., fast R-CNN, faster R-CNN and Yolo). But nevertheless, the implementation of the R-CNN is simple, and serves as a powerful bench mark for various object detection tasks. So for that reason, this blog  will review the R-CNN algorithm. \n",

    "The clever idea of the R-CNN lies in generalizing or \"transfering\" the CNN classification results on ImageNet to object detection on the PASCAL VOC challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN has been successful in image classification competitions such as ImageNet.\n",
    "The goal of image classifications is to identify the class label of the image. \n",
    "Here, a single image is assumed to have a single label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike image classification, object detection requires localizing and identifying many objects within an image. \n",
    "Here, a single image may contain multiple class objects. \n",
    "So in some sense, object detection is more complex task than the object detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short summary, the R-CNN generates around 2,000 category-independent region proposals for the input image, extracts a fixed length feature vector from each proposal using a CNN, and then classifies each region with category-specific linear SVMs. This process is summarized in the Figure 1 of [Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524) shown below. \n",
